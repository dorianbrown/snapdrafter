Release 6.1:
- When scanning a picture, we now determine the best orientation automatically by checking which has the most detections
- Updated image processing screen to freeze less during loading

Release 6.0:
- When adding a deck and fine-tuning the detection results, newly added cards are now blank instead of Fblthp. Should save some time backspacing
- Decks can now be tagged, the tags are shown in the overview, and you can filter your decks by tag. Should solve a lot of different use-cases (folders, extra deck metadata, etc)
- Added the option to filter by deck colors. Seems like a no-brainer that I somehow missed when putting this together
